## Reporting a Vulnerability

If a vulnerability of any severity is found, please message me (wsnek) through GitHub or email me.
You can expect to get a response acknowledging the vulnerability either the same or next day,
and will receive updates on the status of the vulernability until it is fully patched out.

If a vulnerability is accepted, immediate action will be taken to prevent potential attempts at
malicious abuse of the vulnerability, and subsequent updates about the status of the vulnerability
will be sent to the reporter.

If a vulnerability is declined for any reason, the person who reported it has no permission or
justification to use the vulnerability for malicious abuse reasons, or 'tip off' others that might
have the intentions of abusing the vulnerability for malicious reasons.
